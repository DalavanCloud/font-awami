Awami Nastaliq font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Awami Nastaliq font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Awami Nastaliq font 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

We are currently working on a Nastaliq-style font which will be called 
Awami Nastaliq.

Awami means "of the people", "of the common population" or "public". It is 
intended to be a font that can be used by a wide variety of languages of
Pakistan, including but not limited to Urdu.

The font does not cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire. It only 
supports characters known to be used by languages in areas of the world using 
the Nastaliq style of Arabic script.

This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex 
typographic issues. Font smarts have been implemented using  Graphite only. We have 
no current plans to support OpenType.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Awami Nastaliq Regular
