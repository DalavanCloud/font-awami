Awami Nastaliq font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Awami Nastaliq font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Awami Nastaliq font 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Awami Nastaliq is a Nastaliq-style Arabic script font supporting a wide variety of 
languages of Southwest Asia, including but not limited to Urdu. This font is aimed 
at minority language support. This makes it unique among Nastaliq fonts.

Awami means "of the people", "of the common population" or "public". 

The Awami Nastaliq font does not provide complete coverage of all the characters 
defined in Unicode for Arabic script. Because the font style is specifically 
intended for languages using the Nastaliq style of southwest Asia, the character 
set for this font is aimed at those languages.

This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex 
typographic issues. Font smarts have been implemented using  Graphite only. We have 
no current plans to support OpenType.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Awami Nastaliq Regular
