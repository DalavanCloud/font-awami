# Awami Nastaliq Graphite Font

Awami Nastaliq is a Nastaliq-style Arabic script font supporting a wide variety of languages of Southwest Asia, including but not limited to Urdu. This font is aimed at minority language support. This makes it unique among Nastaliq fonts.

## Project status [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_Awami/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_Awami&guest=1)  

This is an **unreleased development** effort currently focused on the following goals:

- Implement shaping behavior and collision avoidance using [SIL Graphite](https://graphite.sil.org) technology.
- Build the font using [SMITH](https://github.com/silnrsi/smith) toolchain.

See the [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt) for information on this and previous releases.

## Known issues

Font compression does not yet work on OSX. We have had to release an uncompressed Graphite font in order for the font to render in XeTeX/XeLaTeX on OSX.

## License

Awami Nastaliq is licensed under the SIL Open Font License. See [OFL.txt](OFL.txt) and [OFL-FAQ.txt](OFL-FAQ.txt) for details.
